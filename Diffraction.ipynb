The core idea is to expand the exponential operator as a series of Chebyshev polynomials $T_n(x)$, where $x$ is a rescaled version of the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H} / \\hbar$, ensuring that the spectrum of $x$ lies in the interval $[-1, 1]$, which is the domain of Chebyshev polynomials.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function $f(x) = e^{-i x t}$ can be expanded in terms of Chebyshev polynomials $T_n(x)$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "   f(x) = e^{-i x t} \\approx \\sum_{n=0}^{N} c_n T_n(x),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $T_n(x)$ are Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind, and the coefficients $c_n$ are given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "   c_n = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{e^{-i t x} T_n(x)}{\\sqrt{1 - x^2}} dx = i^n J_n(t),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $J_n(t)$ are the Bessel functions of the first kind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the expansion coefficients $c_n$ are determined, the time-evolved state can be computed as a linear combination of Chebyshev polynomials applied to the rescaled Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "   \\Psi(t) \\approx \\sum_{n=0}^{N} c_n T_n(\\hat{H}) \\Psi(0).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "The action of the Chebyshev polynomials $T_n(\\hat{H})$ on the initial state $\\Psi(0)$ is computed recursively using the recurrence relation for Chebyshev polynomials:\n",
    "   \n",
    "$$\n",
    "   T_0(x) = 1, \\quad T_1(x) = x, \\quad T_{n+1}(x) = 2x T_n(x) - T_{n-1}(x).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "So, starting with $\\Psi_0 = \\Psi(t=0)$ and $\\Psi_1 = \\hat{H} \\Psi_0$, we can compute $\\Psi_n = T_n(\\hat{H}) \\Psi_0$ recursively for $n = 2, 3, \\dots, N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the series is truncated at a finite number $N$, which is determined by the desired accuracy and the properties of the Hamiltonian and time evolution. The error decreases exponentially with the number of terms due to the rapid convergence of the Chebyshev expansion for smooth functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial state $\\Psi(0)$ can be presentred int the form Gaussian wave packet $\\Psi(t=0) \\propto \\exp\\left({-(x/x_0)^2 - (y/y_0)^2}\\right)$. Free propagation of a 2D wave packet:"

This is exactly similar to the observation that blue light is diffracted less strongly than red light, which arises because the wavelength of blue light is smaller than that of red and hence its energy is larger.)\n",
